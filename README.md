# Odin Etch-A-Sketch Project
## By: Eli Barela

A project from the Odin Project to implement a website version of an "etch-a-sketch", including the ability to resize and reset the grid when needed, while keep the same general grid size. I also decided to implement opacity changing and a button that can let you change from having an "only black" color to a "random colors" setting. 

### Potential Updates

Impement a way to choose the color you want as a solid choice

Add in a way to change how much opacity is changing when a mouse hovers over the squares.
